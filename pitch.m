# Unnamed Goblin Server

Unnamed Goblin Server (UGS) is a Minecraft RPG-inspired dungeon crawler server focused on cooperative gameplay to expand wealth and reputation. The server offers procedurally generated dungeons for players to explore, improve their skills and stats, find better gear, and unlock new features. Once players have obtained powerful gear and stats, they can establish empires in a custom-generated open world by claiming land. As their reputation and influence grow, they can expand their territory and invite more players to join their group. UGS encourages player-driven content creation through activities such as warfare, trading, alliances, and the creation of an evolving storyline.

## Target Audience
The server caters to anyone who enjoys dungeon crawlers and open-world MMORPGs.

## Key Features
- Unique, one-of-a-kind dungeon system
- Many unique features and custom textures for an immersive experience

## Team
- Alex: Lead developer and creator of UGS
- Myka: Lead Web Developer and co-founder
- Nathaniel: Lead Game Designer and modeler
- Lucas: Project Manager and Secretary
- John: Modeler and opinion haver
- Keenan: Discord Developer and soon-to-be in-game developer

## Story and Gameplay
The story in UGS is revealed through hidden lore found on items discovered in dungeons and through event quest lines introduced with new bosses or dungeons. The main gameplay loop revolves around evolving procedural dungeons and AI-generated items that scale with the player's level, ensuring a sense of progress and rewarding loot. Players can access boss dungeons, participate in quest-line events, or explore the procedural dungeon to test their limits. Dungeons are randomly generated and require keys, which players can acquire by purchasing or crafting them from NPCs at spawn.

Once players feel ready, they can venture into the wild and establish their own empires. The title and rank of their empire are determined by the number of players in their group. They can form alliances or engage in wars using taxes collected from granting other players access to their land. Players gather resources from a custom-generated resource world featuring unique resources.

This allows players to engage in dungeon crawling, PvP, or survival in the custom world without adding additional workload for the development team.

## Unique Selling Proposition
UGS stands out due to its custom items, mobs, world, and unique dungeon system. Being among the first servers to incorporate features recently added to Minecraft, UGS offers a distinct advantage. Unlike OG Minecraft servers that required modding knowledge, UGS allows anyone to join without modding requirements. The unique art style of the mobs blends seamlessly with Minecraft's aesthetics while offering a fresh and unseen experience.

- Influencer Engagement: Collaborate with Minecraft influencers and streamers, granting them early access to the game and encouraging them to share gameplay experiences and reviews.
- Content Marketing: Regularly publish blogs and social media posts detailing game updates, new dungeons, upcoming events, and other features. Share lore snippets periodically to maintain community engagement.
- Beta Test: Conduct a beta test with a small group of players to gather feedback for improvements and create organic word-of-mouth promotion.
- Launch Event: Organize a grand virtual launch event featuring live gameplay, developer interactions, community Q&A sessions, and more.

## Community Management
Effective community management is essential for maintaining player engagement and satisfaction. The following strategies will be implemented:

- Engagement: Regularly interact with the community through forums, Discord, social media, and in-game chat. Encourage discussions, answer queries, and gather feedback.
- Competitions and Events: Organize weekly/monthly competitions or events, such as guild wars or dungeon raids, with in-game rewards to keep players invested.
- Player Support: Establish robust player support, including comprehensive FAQs, tutorials, and a dedicated support team to address technical issues and game-related queries.

## Planned Updates
To keep the game fresh and exciting, the following updates are planned:

- New Dungeons and Bosses: Regularly release new procedurally generated dungeons and challenging bosses.
- Lore Expansions: Periodically expand the game's lore, adding depth to the narrative and immersing players in the world.
- Game Balancing: Continuously adjust game balance based on player feedback and data analytics to ensure a fair and enjoyable experience for all.
- New Features: Gradually introduce new gameplay features, such as additional custom resources and advanced crafting options.

## Monetization Strategy
UGS aims to monetize the game without compromising fairness and player experience. The following strategies will be employed:

- Cosmetic Microtransactions: Offer purely cosmetic items for purchase, including unique hats for player characters, custom building textures, and exclusive pet mobs. This approach ensures the game remains non-pay-to-win while providing monetization opportunities.
- Premium Membership: Introduce a subscription-based premium membership offering benefits such as free weekly Cosmetic keys, access to special events or areas on the Discord server, and priority queue to dungeons in case of loading delays. Premium membership does not provide direct gameplay advantages.

By prioritizing an immersive player experience and maintaining a balanced approach to monetization, UGS aims to provide an engaging Minecraft RPG experience that attracts and retains a dedicated player base.
